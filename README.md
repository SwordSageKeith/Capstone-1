Character Manager is a tool to help players store and use Dungeons and Dragons 5e characters.
Users can create an account and create however many characters they wish.

live app: https://character-manager.herokuapp.com

The goal was to make a user freindly app that allows players to easily access key character information.
There is still some work to be done, like editing or deleting characters.

The main page displays a list of all the characters a user has, that are buttons to switch to that character.
The page displays character information in 4 sections. The first is basic information about the character,
such as name, race, and level. The second seciton displays the 6 core stats that a character has.
